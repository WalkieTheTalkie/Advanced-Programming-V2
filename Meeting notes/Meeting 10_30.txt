Notes from 110/30/2019 meeting with group

Give new employee an idea with through the use of a random number generator for both employees and volunteer but
seperate them through the size of the id(one might have more group might have more digits than the other). It cant
have repeats


One admin log-in, and this admin can then later choose to add other admin into the database

for presentation on thursada the 31st, Ben will take care of the home and new user section, Rachel will take care
of the admin, Luke will take care of Employee, Angel will take care of Volunteer.

Data that will be stored in the database will have user specific restrictions that can view certain amounts of information
-luke will look into this further
